This is the source code for a now abandoned project, NeuronPM.

NeuronPM was written circa 2005 using Php4 and DotNet 2.0.  It has not been updated since 2007, so it does not currently run in modern environments (e.g. with Php7).  This source code is provided for historical purposes and to provide a foundation for anyone who might be interested in updating the code.

NeuronPm was described in this paper:
* Calin-Jageman, R. J., & Katz, P. S. (2006). A distributed computing tool for generating neural simulation databases. Neural Computation, 18(12), 2923–7. http://doi.org/10.1162/neco.2006.18.12.2923

And then a more advanced system was built (NeuronGrid) and described in this paper:
* Calin-Jageman, R. J., Xie, C., Pan, Y., Vandenberg, A., & Katz, P. S. (2007). NEURONgrid: A Toolkit for Generating Parameter-Space Maps Using NEURON in a Grid Environment. In Bioinformatics Research and Applications (Vol. 4463, pp. 182–191). Berlin, Heidelberg: Springer Berlin Heidelberg. http://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-72031-7_17


NeuronPM is a free client/server application that makes parameter maps for neural simulations written in NEURON (Hines & Carnevale, 2003). NeuronPM takes an existing set of Neuron model files, publishes them on a server, and runs them on client computers as a Windows screen-saver. Thus, it lets you lash together idle Windows machines to make a primitive grid that can rapidly map a large parameter space for your model. NeuronPM is designed to be easy to use and install--an attempt to make large-scale parameter analysis more widely available for neuroscientists.)
